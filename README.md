In this project, we will explore a supply-chain dataset sourced from the USAID website, specifically the USAID GHSC PSM Health Commodity Delivery Dataset. Our primary objective is to investigate whether various features within the dataset influence the rate price for transporting goods. This will be approached as a regression problem, allowing us to apply different machine learning models, including the Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, and Linear Regression.

To ensure a thorough understanding of the dataset and uncover underlying patterns, we will conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This will involve visualizing the data, analyzing distributions, and identifying any correlations between features and the target variable. Depending on the insights gained from EDA, we may perform feature engineering to enhance the dataset, ensuring our models can effectively learn from the available data.

Through this project, we aim to derive actionable insights that could improve decision-making in supply chain management and optimize transportation costs for health commodities.
